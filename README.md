Quantum-Enhanced Signal Processing for Brain-Computer Interfaces
This project demonstrates the integration of quantum and classical signal processing techniques for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. It includes modules for generating and simulating quantum Fourier transforms (QFT) and for implementing classical as well as quantum-enhanced Kalman filters. These tools are designed to explore how quantum algorithms could eventually enhance the processing and tracking of neural signals.

Module Descriptions
qfft_module.py
Purpose:
Implements functions to:
Generate a Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuit using Qiskit.
Compute a classical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on simulated EEG-like signals.
Compare QFT simulation outcomes with classical FFT results.
Key Functions:
generate_qft_circuit(n): Creates an n-qubit QFT circuit (with measurements).
classical_fft(signal): Computes the FFT of a signal.
simulate_qft_circuit(circuit, shots): Simulates a given QFT circuit on Qiskit’s Aer simulator.
qkalman_module.py
Purpose:
Provides implementations for:
A classical Kalman filter for tracking neural signal changes.
A quantum-enhanced Kalman filter where the only difference is in the matrix inversion step.
Key Functions:
classical_kalman_filter(zs, A, H, Q, R, x0, P0): Runs the standard Kalman filter.
quantum_matrix_inversion(M, method="classical"): By default, calls np.linalg.inv(M) but can be configured to use a prototype HHL-based inversion (quantum_matrix_inversion_hhl) in future.
quantum_kalman_filter(zs, A, H, Q, R, x0, P0, inversion_method="classical"): Runs the Kalman filter using the selected inversion method.
Notebook Descriptions
QFT_Notebook.ipynb
Overview:
Demonstrates how to:
Generate and visualize a QFT circuit.
Simulate the QFT circuit using Qiskit's Aer simulator.
Compute and compare a classical FFT on simulated EEG-like data.
Highlights:
Visualizations of the QFT circuit and FFT plots.
Side-by-side comparison of quantum and classical Fourier transform methods.
KalmanFilter_Notebook.ipynb
Overview:
Illustrates the tracking of complex, realistic EEG-like signals using:
A classical Kalman filter.
A quantum-enhanced Kalman filter (with a placeholder quantum inversion).
Highlights:
Simulation of realistic EEG amplitude envelopes featuring baseline modulation and transient spikes.
Visualizations comparing the true signal, noisy measurements, and estimates from both filters.
Performance evaluations using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and Pearson correlation.
Additional plots (time-series, scatter plots, and bar charts) to assess and compare filter performance.
Requirements & Installation
This project requires:

Python 3.9+
Qiskit and Qiskit-Aer (for quantum circuit simulation)
NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas
pylatexenc (for LaTeX rendering in Qiskit circuits)
You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer numpy scipy matplotlib pandas pylatexenc
Or using conda:

bash
Copy
conda install -c conda-forge qiskit qiskit-aer numpy scipy matplotlib pandas pylatexenc
How to Run
Place all files in the same directory.

Run the Notebooks:

Open QFT_Notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially to see the QFT and FFT demonstrations.
Open KalmanFilter_Notebook.ipynb to simulate EEG signals and apply both the classical and quantum-enhanced Kalman filters. Make sure to reload the modules (qfft_module.py and qkalman_module.py) if you make changes.
Notes
Quantum-Enhanced Kalman Filter:
Currently, the quantum-enhanced Kalman filter uses a placeholder for the quantum matrix inversion step (i.e., it calls the classical inversion routine). A prototype version based on the HHL algorithm is included as an example in the module, but practical benefits would only be seen with a true quantum subroutine on compatible quantum hardware.

QFT Simulations:
The QFT simulations use Qiskit's Aer simulator. Adjust your Qiskit version or installation as needed if you encounter module import issues.
