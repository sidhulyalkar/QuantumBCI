qkalman_module.py

This module provides implementations of classical and quantum-enhanced Kalman filters 
for neural signal tracking. It includes:

- classical_kalman_filter: A classical Kalman filter implementation.
- quantum_matrix_inversion: A placeholder function for quantum-enhanced matrix inversion.
- quantum_kalman_filter: A Kalman filter that uses quantum_matrix_inversion instead of the classical inversion.

In a full quantum-enhanced filter, the inversion routine could be replaced by a quantum algorithm 
(e.g. HHL) to accelerate high-dimensional linear algebra.

    Prototype for a quantum-enhanced matrix inversion using the HHL algorithm.
    
    This function uses Qiskit Aqua's HHL algorithm to compute the inverse of a Hermitian matrix M.
    It does so by solving M x = e_i for each column (with e_i being the i-th standard basis vector)
    and then assembling these solutions into the inverse matrix.

      M (ndarray): A Hermitian matrix to be inverted.

      ndarray: An approximation of the inverse of M as computed via HHL.
      
    Note: This is experimental code. HHL requires that M be Hermitian and properly scaled;
    furthermore, the algorithm is probabilistic and sensitive to noise. On current NISQ devices
